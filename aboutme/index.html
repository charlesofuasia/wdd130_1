        <h2>Charles Ofuasia</h2>
        <h4>Chizzy</h4>
        <p>My name is Charles and I live in Lagos, Nigeria where I operate my private optometry practice. I am married and have two sons. 
            I am pursuing a degree in Applied Technology from Brigham Young University, Idaho and hope to acquire the necessary skills and
            knowledge to pursue a full-time career in information technology.
            I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints where I also serve as a counsellor in the Elder's Quorum and an 
            Institute teacher and I love the Lord.
